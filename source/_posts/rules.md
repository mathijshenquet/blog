Why do we live in a universe where everything happens by essentially[^1] deterministic rules? This is a philosophical question I wont get into but I would like to give a mathematical perspective.

Suppose we want to simulate a toy universe. By formulating a finite set of rules we ensure that the universe's step function is computable. Indeed without it we would need an infinite amount of information, either upfront or as-we-go, to serve as 'inspiration' for the next time steps. There is no way around this, for if the infinite amount of data is really generated by some rule, we can simply incorporate that rule into our set of rules which will then be finite again.
